 * The JaasAuthenticationCallbackHandler is similar to the

 * method. The JaasAuthenticationCallbackHandler is only asked to handle one Callback
 * instance at time rather than an array of all Callbacks, as the javax...
 * CallbackHandler defines.
 *
 * <p>
 * Before a JaasAuthenticationCallbackHandler is asked to 'handle' any callbacks, it is
 * first passed the Authentication object that the login attempt is for. NOTE: The
 * Authentication object has not been 'authenticated' yet.
