/**
 * Annotation for specifying a method filtering expression which will be evaluated before
 * a method has been invoked. The name of the argument to be filtered is specified using
 * the <tt>filterTarget</tt> attribute. This must be a Java Collection implementation
 * which supports the {@link java.util.Collection#remove(Object) remove} method.
 * Pre-filtering isn't supported on array types and will fail if the value of named filter
 * target argument is null at runtime.
 * <p>
 * For methods which have a single argument which is a collection type, this argument will
 * be used as the filter target.
 * <p>
 * The annotation value contains the expression which will be evaluated for each element
 * in the collection. If the expression evaluates to false, the element will be removed.
 * The reserved name "filterObject" can be used within the expression to refer to the
 * current object which is being evaluated.
