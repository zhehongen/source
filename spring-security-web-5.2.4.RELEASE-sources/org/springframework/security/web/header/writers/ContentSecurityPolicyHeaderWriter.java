/**
 * <p>
 * Provides support for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/">Content Security Policy (CSP) Level 2</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * CSP provides a mechanism for web applications to mitigate content injection vulnerabilities,
 * such as cross-site scripting (XSS). CSP is a declarative policy that allows web application authors to inform
 * the client (user-agent) about the sources from which the application expects to load resources.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, a web application can declare that it only expects to load script from specific, trusted sources.
 * This declaration allows the client to detect and block malicious scripts injected into the application by an attacker.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A declaration of a security policy contains a set of security policy directives (for example, script-src and object-src),
 * each responsible for declaring the restrictions for a particular resource type.
 * The list of directives defined can be found at
 * <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#directives">Directives</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each directive has a name and value. For detailed syntax on writing security policies, see
 * <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#syntax-and-algorithms">Syntax and Algorithms</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation of {@link HeaderWriter} writes one of the following headers:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Content-Security-Policy</li>
 * 	<li>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, the Content-Security-Policy header is included in the response.
 * However, calling {@link #setReportOnly(boolean)} with {@code true} will include the
 * Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only header in the response.
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> The supplied security policy directive(s) will be used for whichever header is enabled (included).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>
 * CSP is not intended as a first line of defense against content injection vulnerabilities.
 * Instead, CSP is used to reduce the harm caused by content injection attacks.
 * As a first line of defense against content injection, web application authors should validate their input and encode their output.
 * </strong>
