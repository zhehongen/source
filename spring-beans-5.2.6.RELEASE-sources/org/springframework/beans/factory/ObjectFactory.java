/**定义一个工厂，该工厂在调用时可以返回Object实例（可能是共享的或独立的）。此接口通常用于封装通用工厂，该通用工厂在每次调用时返回某个目标对象的新实例（原型）。此接口与FactoryBean相似，但是后者的实现通常是在BeanFactory定义为SPI实例，而此类的实现通常是作为API馈入其他Bean（通过注入）。 这样， getObject()方法具有不同的异常处理行为

 * <p>This interface is similar to {@link FactoryBean}, but implementations
 * of the latter are normally meant to be defined as SPI instances in a
