 * A ShutdownListener receives information about the shutdown of connections and
 * channels. Note that when a connection is shut down, its associated channels are also
 * considered shut down and their ShutdownListeners will be notified (with the same cause).
 * Because of this, and the fact that channel ShutdownListeners execute in the connection's
 * thread, attempting to make blocking calls on a connection inside the listener will
 * lead to deadlock.
